        <p>Abia State, located in the southeastern region of Nigeria, is one of the
           countryâ€™s 36 states and was created in 1991 from part of Imo State. With
           Umuahia as its capital and Aba as its commercial hub, Abia is known for 
           its strong industrial base, especially in areas like textile production,
           leather works, and crafts. The state is predominantly inhabited by the 
           Igbo people and is rich in culture, entrepreneurship, and hospitality. 
           Abia also has a growing agricultural sector, producing crops such as 
           cassava, yam, and palm oil. Its name is an acronym derived from the four 
           initial local government areas: Aba, Bende, Isuikwuato, and Afikpo.
